Make the non-academic resume work:

Problem with Fira Sans. Did different things: installed packages(s) from TRAN, put them in the correct folder (I hope?). But it kept complaining. Added \usepackage{fira} to tex file. Did not work.

Also installed:


Eventually, in the Rmd file, I changed "sansfont: Fira Sans" to "sansfont: cochineal".

Now error is about FontAwesome (can't find file FontAwesome).
Added \usepackage{fontspec} to tex file (https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/132888/fontawesome-font-not-found). Still does not work.

Ended up (re)installing tinytex. Got a warning that usr/local/bin was not writable so made it writable with sudo chmod a+w bin. Re-installed and called it.

FYI fontawesome icons: https://fontawesome.com/v5/search

Tried:
Alternatively, you can compile your .Rmd file with xelatex in RStudio by going to Tools > Global Options > Sweave and in Typeset LaTeX into PDF using: choose XeLaTeX.
Also did not work.

Set it back to pdfLatex again

Followed these instructions: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/369068/how-can-i-use-the-fontawesome-package-with-xelatex

Ran
sudo updmap-sys
kpsewhich fontawesome.map
sudo -u tlusr updmap-sys #failed, no tlusr

Tried to add
\newfontfamily{\FA}{fontawesome.otf}
to svm-resume-example.
No luck

WHAT WORKED!
Moved folder fontawesome and fontawesome5 to Library/Fonts...
Output looks janky but okay. Commented all the other crap out again. Kept only \usepackage{fontawesome}
Still works

Did the same thing with fira and firamath.
Changed sanfont back Fira Sans.
WORKS!
Updated usepackage to fontawesome5 but I don't think it make a difference.

Warnings: 
Command \underbar  has changed
Command \underline  has changed.

#####################
It all comes down to the YAML header.
Trying to figure out how to set this up. According to the book, I should be able to set it up any way, using html and tex interchangeably.

#########################################################################
Ended up going back to the resume template that comes with pagedown.
Uses fontawesome4. How to get to 5?
Supposedly: https://fontawesome.com/kits/c5710c4819/use
Fontawesome4 info: https://fontawesome.com/v4/examples

There is a css file that can be changed: pagedown/inst/resources/css/resume.css
And an html file: pagedown/inst/resources/html/resume.html
Css controls layout and and presentation (position). Overall look and formatting. Html just turns it into a webpage, identifies headers etc, structure of webpage

I could also add a tex file, I think? But let's start with html and css first.
Made separate css file:
- change font 
- change header from all capitals to regular capitalized
- change url link color to purple (for colors, just google css colors)

- Move text under education closer together: remove data-concise = true in the Rmarkdown (I think in the css file, this is the part that might add the space:

.main-block.concise .details div:not(.concise){
  /* use padding to work around the fact that margin doesn't affect floated
     neighboring elements */
  padding: 0.05in 0 0.07in 0;
}
- Have text on second page run across, or run sidebar on second page as well?

Added academic icon

TO DO
Make right margins smaller so text in ribbon fits better (also left margins)
Make work at UF one entry
Make professional summary short
Remove right ribbon on second page? Make everything fit on one page?

Def get rid of ribbon on 2nd page, or figure out how to put info on the ribbon
Smaller headers in ribbon. Less space between header and text. Make ribbon different color. Add the thing with dots/stars with skills. Change R programming language to R.
