## Resume

This is an attempt to create a resume in RMarkdown.

The template used is from the `pagedown` package. After installing this package, open RStudio, click on File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From template -> HTML Resume.

Currently, the text file "fix_resume_code.txt" contains changes made to the CSS and HTML files. This will be transferred to this README once complete.
